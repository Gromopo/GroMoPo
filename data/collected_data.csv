Abstract

Parsimonious groundwater modeling provides insight into hydrogeologic functioning of the Nubian Aquifer System (NAS), the world’s largest non-renewable groundwater system (belonging to Chad, Egypt, Libya, and Sudan). Classical groundwater-resource issues exist (magnitude and lateral extent of drawdown near pumping centers) with joint international management questions regarding transboundary drawdown. Much of NAS is thick, containing a large volume of high-quality groundwater, but receives insignificant recharge, so water-resource availability is time-limited. Informative aquifer data are lacking regarding large-scale response, providing only local-scale information near pumps. Proxy data provide primary underpinning for understanding regional response: Holocene water-table decline from the previous pluvial period, after thousands of years, results in current oasis/sabkha locations where the water table still intersects the ground. Depletion is found to be controlled by two regional parameters, hydraulic diffusivity and vertical anisotropy of permeability. Secondary data that provide insight are drawdowns near pumps and isotope-groundwater ages (million-year-old groundwaters in Egypt). The resultant strong simply structured three-dimensional model representation captures the essence of NAS regional groundwater-flow behavior. Model forecasts inform resource management that transboundary drawdown will likely be minimal—a nonissue—whereas drawdown within pumping centers may become excessive, requiring alternative extraction schemes; correspondingly, significant water-table drawdown may occur in pumping centers co-located with oases, causing oasis loss and environmental impacts.

Résumé

Une modélisation simplifiée de la nappe donne un aperçu du fonctionnement hydrogéologique du Système Aquifère Nubien, le plus grand aquifère non alimenté du monde (Tchad, Egypte, Lybie, Soudan). Les problèmes classiques liés à la ressource en eau souterraine existent (amplitude du rabattement et rayon d’influence des stations de pompage), avec des questions de gestion internationale coordonnée des rabattements transfrontaliers. Le Système Aquifère Nubien est épais dans sa plus grande partie, il contient une nappe de grande qualité mais reçoit une recharge insignifiante, de sorte que la disponibilité de la ressource en eau est limitée dans le temps. Les données sur l’aquifère modélisé font défaut pour ce qui est de la réponse à grande échelle, elles fournissent seulement des informations autour des pompages. Des données transposées fournissent une base essentielle pour la compréhension de la réponse régionale. L’abaissement du niveau de la nappe holocène depuis la fin de la période pluvieuse précédente, il y a des milliers d’années, conduit aux oasis et sebkha actuelles, lieux où la surface de la nappe recoupe la surface du sol. La baisse est contrôlée par deux paramètres régionaux, la diffusivité hydraulique et l’anisotropie verticale de la perméabilité. Les données secondaires qui fournissent un aperçu sur le fonctionnement sont les rabattements près des stations de pompage et l’âge isotopique des eaux souterraines (un million d’années en Egypte). Le modèle tridimensionnel résultant, structuré de façon fortement simplifiée cerne l’essentiel du comportement de l’écoulement souterrain régional du Système Aquifère Nubien. Le modèle prévisionnel informe le gestionnaire de la ressource que le rabattement transfrontalier sera vraisemblablement minimal—un non problème—quoique le rabattement autour des stations de pompage puisse devenir excessif, nécessitant des schémas alternatifs de prélèvement et qu’un rabattement significatif puisse se produire autour des stations de pompages localisées dans les oasis, provoquant leur ruine et des impacts environnementaux.

Resumen

Un escaso modelado del agua subterránea proporciona una visión del funcionamiento hidrogeológico del Sistema Acuífero Nubio (NAS), el mayor sistema de agua subterránea no renovable del mundo (en Chad, Egipto, Libia, Sudan). Existen temas clásicos del recurso de agua subterránea (magnitud y extensión lateral del descenso del nivel de agua próximo a centros de bombeo) con cuestiones de manejo internacional conjunto en relación con el descenso del nivel de agua transnacional. Mucho del NAS de gran espesor, contiene agua subterránea de alta calidad, pero recibe una recarga insignificante, de manera que la disponibilidad del recurso agua está limitada en el tiempo. Se carece de datos informativos en relación a su respuesta a gran escala, proporcionándose sólo información a escala local cerca de los bombeos. Los datos de proximidad proporcionan un soporte primario para entender la respuesta regional. El descenso del nivel freático Holoceno a partir del período lluvioso previo, después de miles de años, resulta en localizaciones actuales de oasis/sabkha donde el nivel freático todavía intersecta la superficie del terreno. El descenso del nivel de agua es controlado por dos parámetros regionales, la difusividad hidráulica y la anisotropía vertical de la permeabilidad. Datos secundarios que proporcionan un conocimiento son los descensos del nivel del agua cerca de los bombeos y las edades isotópicas del agua subterránea (aguas subterráneas de un millón de años en Egipto). La representación resultante, fuerte y simplemente estructurada del modelo tridimensional captura la esencia del comportamiento del flujo regional de agua subterránea del NAS. Los pronósticos del modelo aportan al manejo del recurso ya que el descenso del nivel de agua transnacional será probablemente mínimo—no problemático—mientras que el descenso dentro de los centros de bombeo pueden convertirse en excesivo, requiriendo esquemas de extracción alternativos, y un descenso significativo del nivel freático puede ocurrir en los centros de bombeo localizados en coincidencia con los oasis, causando la pérdida de oasis e impactos ambientales.

摘要

的地下水模拟论述了世界上最 大的不可更新的地下水 系统--(乍得、埃及、利比亚和苏丹的)努比亚含水层系统的水文地质情况。典型的地下水资源问题与有关跨国界抽水的联合的国际管理问题共存。大部分努比亚含水层系统很 厚,包含高质量的地下水,但是接受很少的补给,因此水资源可用量有 时间上的限制。有关大规模响应方面的含水层资料匮乏,只有抽水井附近的局部 规模的信息。替代性资料为了解区域 响应提供了主要支持。从前一个洪积期全新世水位下降,几千年后导致形成了目前的绿洲/盐沼,这里的水位仍然贯穿地面。消耗受两个 区域参数 控制,水利扩散系数和渗透的垂直各向异性。次级资料为水泵附近的抽水资料及同位素地下水年龄(埃及百万年的地下水)。合成、牢固、简单结构的三维模型获得了努比亚含水层系统区域 地下水 水流特性。模型预测结果告知了资源管理部门,跨国界水位下降可能很小-不是个问题—而抽水中心 分内的下降可能过度,需要采取更替抽水的 方案,重大的 水位下降可能出现在抽水中心—与绿洲在同一位置,引起绿洲萎缩和 环境影响。

Resumo

A modelação parcimoniosa de águas subterrâneas fornece perceções sobre o funcionamento hidrogeológico do Sistema Aquífero Núbio (SAN), o maior sistema de água subterrânea não renovável do mundo (Chade, Egito, Líbia, Sudão). Neste sistema existem os problemas clássicos dos recursos hídricos subterrâneos (magnitude e extensão lateral do rebaixamento nas proximidades de centros de bombeamento), associadas a questões de gestão internacionais que dizem respeito a rebaixamentos transfronteiriços. Grande parte do SAN é de grande espessura, contendo águas subterrâneas de alta qualidade, mas recebe uma recarga insignificante, apresentando portanto uma disponibilidade hídrica temporalmente limitada. Há falta de dados que permitam prever respostas do aquífero a grande escala, providenciando apenas informações a escala local, na vizinhança dos pontos de bombeamento. Os dados de proximidade às captações não permitem a avaliação da resposta regional: o rebaixamento do nível freático do Holocénico a partir do período pluvioso anterior, após milhares de anos, resulta na localização atual dos oásis/sabkha, onde o nível freático ainda interseta a superfície. O grande exaurimento é controlado por dois parâmetros regionais, a difusividade hidráulica e a anisotropia da permeabilidade vertical. Os dados secundários que fornecem informações são os rebaixamentos perto dos pontos de bombeamento e as idades das águas subterrâneas estimadas por métodos isotópicos (da ordem dos milhões de anos no Egito). A forte representação da estrutura simples do modelo tridimensional capta o fundamental do comportamento do fluxo regional de águas subterrâneas do SAN. Previsões do modelo de gestão de recursos informam que os rebaixamentos transfronteiriços serão provavelmente mínimos—um não problema—enquanto os rebaixamentos na área de influência dos centros de bombeamento podem tornar-se excessivos, necessitando de esquemas de extração alternativos, e significativos nos centros de bombeamento co-localizados em zonas de oásis, causando perdas e impactes ambientais nesses oásis.",""

In order to estimate the sustainability of Santa Barbara’s groundwater basins, a three-dimensional density-dependent groundwater-flow and solute-transport model (the Santa Barbara Flow and Transport Model, or SBFTM) was developed on the basis of an existing groundwater-flow model. To simulate seawater intrusion to the Santa Barbara Basin under various management strategies, the SBFTM uses the USGS code SEAWAT to simulate salinity transport and variable-density flow. The completed SBFTM was coupled with a management optimization tool, in this case a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to determine optimal pumping strategies that maximize the sustainable yield and at the same time satisfy user-defined drawdown and chloride concentration constraints.","30 or more"

The model used aimed for a solution that obtains a nationwide overview of groundwater that bridges the gap between the (too-)expensive advanced local models and the (too-)simple global-scale models. The model is inspired by an existing, global-scale, groundwater flow model and improved by feeding in national input data of New Zealand terrain, geology, and recharge, and by slight adjustment of model parametrisation and model testing.

The U.S. Geological Survey completed a comprehensive, integrated analysis of available hydrogeologic data to develop a numerical groundwater-flow model of the Edwards-Trinity and related aquifers in the study area in parts of Brewster, Jeff Davis, Pecos, and Reeves Counties. The active model area covers about 3,400 square miles of the Pecos County region of Texas west of the Pecos River, and its boundaries were defined to include the saturated areas of the Edwards-Trinity aquifer. The model is a five-layer representation of the Pecos Valley, Edwards-Trinity, Dockum, and Rustler aquifers. The Pecos Valley aquifer is referred to as the alluvial layer, and the Edwards-Trinity aquifer is divided into layers representing the Edwards part of the Edwards-Trinity aquifer and the Trinity part of the Edwards-Trinity aquifer, respectively. The calibration period of the simulation extends from 1940 to 2010. Simulated hydraulic heads generally were in good agreement with observed values; 1,684 out of 2,860 (59 percent) of the simulated values were within 25 feet of the observed value. The average root mean square error value of hydraulic head for the Edwards-Trinity aquifer was 34.2 feet, which was approximately 4 percent of the average total observed change in groundwater-level altitude (groundwater level). Simulated spring flow representing Comanche Springs exhibits a pattern similar to observed spring flow. Independent geochemical modeling corroborates results of simulated groundwater flow that indicates groundwater in the Edwards-Trinity aquifer in the Leon-Belding and Fort Stockton areas is a mixture of recharge from the Barilla and Davis Mountains and groundwater that has upwelled from the Rustler aquifer.

The model was used to simulate groundwater-level altitudes resulting from prolonged pumping to evaluate sustainability of current and projected water-use demands. Each of three scenarios utilized a continuation of the calibrated model. Scenario 1 extended recent (2008) irrigation and nonirrigation pumping values for a 30-year period from 2010 to 2040. Projected groundwater-level changes in and around the Fort Stockton area under scenario 1 change little from current conditions, indicating that the groundwater system is near equilibrium with respect to recent (2008) pumping stress. Projected groundwater-level declines in the eastern part of the model area ranging from 5.0 to 15.0 feet are likely the result of nonequilibrium conditions associated with recent increases in pumping after a prolonged water-level recovery period of little or no pumping. Projected groundwater-level declines (from 15.0 to 31.0 feet) occurred in localized areas by the end of scenario 1 in the Leon-Belding area. Scenario 2 evaluated the effects of extended recent (2008) pumping rates as assigned in scenario 1 with year-round maximum permitted pumping rates in the Belding area. Results of scenario 2 are similar in water-level decline and extent as those of scenario 1. The extent of the projected groundwater-level decline in the range from 5.0 to 15.0 feet in the Leon-Belding irrigation area expanded slightly (about a 2-percent increase) from that of scenario 1. Maximum projected groundwater-level declines in the Leon-Belding irrigation area were approximately 31.3 feet in small isolated areas. Scenario 3 evaluated the effects of periodic increases in pumping rates over the 30-year extended period. Results of scenario 3 are similar to those of scenario 2 in terms of the areas of groundwater-level decline; however, the maximum projected groundwater-level decline increased to approximately 34.5 feet in the Leon-Belding area, and the extent of the decline was larger in area (about a 17-percent increase) than that of scenario 2. Additionally, the area of projected groundwater-level declines in the eastern part of the model area increased from that of scenario 2—two individual areas of decline coalesced into one larger area. The localized nature of the projected groundwater-level declines is a reflection of the high degree of fractured control on storage and hydraulic conductivity in the Edwards-Trinity aquifer. Additionally, the finding that simulated spring flow is highly dependent on the transient nature of hydraulic heads in the underlying aquifer indicates the importance of adequately understanding and characterizing the entire groundwater system.","15 Minutes"

As such, long-term planning and management are essential to ensure continued availability of groundwater and surface water for years to come. The Mississippi Embayment Regional Aquifer Study (MERAS) model was developed previously as a tool to evaluate groundwater availability within the Mississippi embayment, which encompasses much of eastern Arkansas where the majority of groundwater is used. The Arkansas Water Plan is being updated for the first time since 1990 and serves as the State’s primary, comprehensive water-resources planning and guidance document. The MERAS model was selected as the best available tool for evaluation of specific water-use pumping scenarios that are currently being considered by the State of Arkansas. The model, developed as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Groundwater Resources Program’s assessment of the Nation’s groundwater availability, is proving to be invaluable to the State as it works toward development of a sustained yield pumping strategy. One aspect of this investigation was to evaluate multiple methods to improve the match of observed to simulated groundwater levels within the Mississippi River Valley alluvial and middle Claiborne (Sparta) aquifers in the MERAS model. Five primary methods were evaluated: (1) explicit simulation of evapotranspiration (ET), (2) upgrade of the Multi-Node Well (MNW2) Package, (3) geometry improvement within the Streamflow Routing (SFR) Package, (4) parameter estimation of select aquifer properties with pilot points, and (5) modification of water-use estimates. For the planning purposes of the Arkansas Water Plan, three scenarios were developed to evaluate potential future conditions: (1) simulation of previously optimized pumping values within the Mississippi River Valley alluvial and the middle Claiborne aquifers, (2) simulated prolonged effects of pumping at average recent (2000–5) rates, and (3) simulation of drawdown constraints on most pumping wells.","30 or more"

Withdrawal of groundwater since development of the aquifer system has resulted in potentiometric surface (hydraulic head, or head) declines in the Gulf Coast aquifer system and land-surface subsidence (primarily in the Houston area) from depressurization and compaction of clay layers interbedded in the aquifer sediments.

The MODFLOW-2000 groundwater flow model described in this report comprises four layers, one for each of the hydrogeologic units of the aquifer system except the Catahoula confining system, the assumed no-flow base of the system. The HAGM is composed of 137 rows and 245 columns of 1-square-mile grid cells with lateral no-flow boundaries at the extent of each hydrogeologic unit to the northwest, at groundwater divides associated with large rivers to the southwest and northeast, and at the downdip limit of freshwater to the southeast. The model was calibrated within the specified criteria by using trial-and-error adjustment of selected model-input data in a series of transient simulations until the model output (potentiometric surfaces, land-surface subsidence, and selected water-budget components) acceptably reproduced field measured (or estimated) aquifer responses including water level and subsidence. The HAGM-simulated subsidence generally compared well to 26 Predictions Relating Effective Stress to Subsidence (PRESS) models in Harris, Galveston, and Fort Bend Counties. Simulated HAGM results indicate that as much as 10 feet (ft) of subsidence has occurred in southeastern Harris County. Measured subsidence and model results indicate that a larger geographic area encompassing this area of maximum subsidence and much of central to southeastern Harris County has subsided at least 6 ft. For the western part of the study area, the HAGM simulated as much as 3 ft of subsidence in Wharton, Jackson, and Matagorda Counties. For the eastern part of the study area, the HAGM simulated as much as 3 ft of subsidence at the boundary of Hardin and Jasper Counties. Additionally, in the southeastern part of the study area in Orange County, the HAGM simulated as much as 3 ft of subsidence. Measured subsidence for these areas in the western and eastern parts of the HAGM has not been documented.","15 Minutes"

USGS Report. https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri014002/","","The proximity of the Mojave River ground-water basin to the highly urbanized Los Angeles region has led to rapid growth in population and, consequently, to an increase in the demand for water. The Mojave River, the primary source of surface water for the region, normally is dry-except for a small stretch of perennial flow and periods of flow after intense storms. Thus, the region relies almost entirely on ground water to meet its agricultural and municipal needs. Ground-water withdrawal since the late 1800's has resulted in discharge, primarily from pumping wells, that exceeds natural recharge. To better understand the relation between the regional and the floodplain aquifer systems and to develop a management tool that could be used to estimate the effects that future stresses may have on the ground-water system, a numerical ground-water flow model of the Mojave River ground-water basin was developed, in part, on the basis of a previously developed analog model.

The ground-water flow model has two horizontal layers; the top layer (layer 1) corresponds to the floodplain aquifer and the bottom layer (layer 2) corresponds to the regional aquifer. There are 161 rows and 200 columns with a horizontal grid spacing of 2,000 by 2,000 feet. Two stress periods (wet and dry) per year are used where the duration of each stress period is a function of the occurrence, quantity of discharge, and length of stormflow from the headwaters each year. A steady-state model provided initial conditions for the transient-state simulation. The model was calibrated to transient-state conditions (1931-94) using a trial-and-error approach.

This article presents a groundwater flow model to assess the GAS system in terms of regional flow patterns, water balance and overall recharge. Despite the continental dimension of GAS, groundwater recharge is restricted to narrow outcrop zones. An important part is discharged into local watersheds, whereas a minor amount reaches the confined part. A three-dimensional finite element groundwater-flow model of the entire GAS system was constructed to obtain a better understanding of the prevailing flow dynamics and more reliable estimates of groundwater recharge. Our results show that recharge rates effectively contributing to the regional GAS water balance are only approximately 0.6 km3/year (about 4.9 mm/year). These rates are much smaller than previous estimates, including of deep recharge approximations commonly used for water resources management. Higher recharge rates were also not compatible with known 81Kr groundwater age estimates, as well as with calculated residence times using a particle tracking algorithm.","15 Minutes"

Objective. To establish the migration route for the leachates generated in El Carrasco landfill, in Bucaramanga, and in the direct and indirect areas of influence of the disposal site, by means of the analysis and the interpretation of the data obtained by the use of geoelectric units. Materials and methods. IT tools were used, including geographic information systems, the Modelmouse software, 180 meters deep vertical electrical soundings with a mesh modeling model comprised of 45 lines and 35 columns -10x10m- and six layers that met the units identified in the direct disposal area by means of a stratigraphic profile. Results. The results of the modeling developed within the MODFLOW environment show an EastWest flow in most of the layers. The same happens with the flow established by the load coming from the Santander mountain range, where the resistivity rates are very low. Conclusion. Low resistivity zones associated, generated by the leachates, and fully saturated zones that were poorly managed in the disposal site, were identified for the area studied, by means of methodologies that combine geophysics, geology, hydrogeology and geochemistry.","15 Minutes"

The Tamarugo is threatened because of groundwater overexploitation, and its preservation depends on the soil moisture in the vadose zone, as many of the tree roots do not reach the current water table levels. To improve the estimation of soil moisture available for the Tamarugo trees, we applied a hydrogeological model that couples the unsaturated and saturated zones. The model was used to represent different groundwater exploitation and recharge scenarios between February 2006 and September 2030 to predict simultaneously groundwater levels and soil moisture. The model results show that even at locations where water table depletion is relatively small (~1–1.5 m), soil moisture can drastically decrease (0.25–0.30 m3/m3). Therefore, Tamarugo survival can be better addressed, as the applied model provides a management tool to estimate response of Tamarugo trees to changing soil moisture. To further improve the model and its use to assess Tamarugo survival, more field data, such as soil hydrodynamic properties and soil moisture, should be collected. Additionally, relationships between the state of the Tamarugo trees and soil moisture should be further constructed. In this way, the developed model will be able to predict future conditions associated to the Tamarugo’s health state.","15 Minutes"
