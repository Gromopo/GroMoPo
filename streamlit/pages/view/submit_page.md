WELCOME NEW USERS!
GroMoPo is a friendly but hungry database that appreciates your time and effort to feed it another delicious groundwater model!
With your help it will grow into an even bigger database and a shoulder to cry on when you need groundwater model data.

GroMoPo will be satisfied if you fill in the mandatory questions that are marked (*) which takes 1-2 minutes.
GroMoPo will be even happier if you add more ingredients (aka answers to the questions), which takes 10-30 minutes for a
model. Information about models can be hard to find so if you are struggling, please don't panic or feel pressured. Just
fill in the information you can find and feel free to complain to GroMoPo at the end of the form about your troubles.
GroMoPo will play detective someday soon and try to solve the mystery of the hard to find data. Anyways, enough
blabbering, let's get cooking!
