# Share a model

We want to make it as easy as possible and have as many models as possible in the portal.

So we have a quick and easy form which takes less than 10 minutes to fill out for a model.

- [Form with mandatory input fields](https://forms.gle/Bxk7E5MX6LHEU54NA)

If you want to stop there, itâ€™s great and someone else in the community will later add more information about the model. Or if want to add additional information:

- Form with optional input fields

We encourage sharing information about any groundwater model even if you did not develop it yourself, so that we can have older or less known models in the database. If you are sharing information about a model that you did not develop, we ask that you send a collegial email to the developer like this (provide example as link) who can the update or modify the information provided.
