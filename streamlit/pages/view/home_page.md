# Why?

Groundwater models are crucial for understanding groundwater science and sustainability but they are not consistently and openly shared. You can explore or share groundwater model data, knowledge, and insights through this unique portal of regional and global numerical groundwater models. We've made it easy! Fly around the world on our map or grab a coffee and share your first model in less than 10 minutes!
