## Vision

Sharing groundwater model data, knowledge and insights more easily through a portal of regional and global numerical groundwater models. The first priority is visualizing and a structured database of existing models, but the portal could eventually include model input and scripts for translating commonly used geospatial datasets into model inputs.
